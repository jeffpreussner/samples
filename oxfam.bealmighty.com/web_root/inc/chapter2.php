						<p>The poultry industry has come a long way. Today it’s a modern model of efficiency and consolidation. Big Poultry has grown from thousands of small farms into an industrial power¬house dominated by a handful of companies that control almost everything—from the chickens and feed to the product distribution network. The top four companies control roughly 60 percent of the market.</p>
						<p>Inside the processing plants, new technologies make it possible to churn through millions of chickens each day. Machines now handle the birds at several stages, but most of the work is still done by hand: from hanging live chickens to cutting wings to trimming skin. Each worker handles thousands of birds every day. The work is rapid, repetitive, and low paying. The injury rate is high, and the atmosphere is oppressive.</p>

As demand for these products grows, the pressure on workers grows too.</p>

						<p>In the drive to keep up productivity, the industry leans on the workers to go ever faster. The maximum speed at which poultry companies can run their processing lines has doubled in the last 35 years, and the poultry industry has been pushing to make the maximum speed even higher. Faster line speeds means higher production, and higher profits for them. But it places a greater strain on workers.</p>
						<p>On the line itself, depending on the job, many workers say they have to process around 35 to 45 birds per minute. This means performing the same task on about one chicken every two seconds: more than 2,000 chickens per hour, more than 14,000 chickens per day. A conservative estimate is that the average worker repeats forceful motions—cutting, pulling, slicing—over 20,000 times per day.</p>
