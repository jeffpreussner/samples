                        <p>Imagine going to work every day knowing you may not be allowed to go to the bathroom for many hours during your shift. You debate wearing an adult diaper because of that. You are likely among the 86% of workers who suffer hand and wrist pain because of repeating the same motions 20,000 times each shift. You face another day of the same. Should your pain become chronic, you risk permanent damage to your hands and arms. Company nurses dismiss your concerns, sending you back to work. Still, the pressure to keep up with the speed of the line is unrelenting. And the check at the end of the week barely sustains you and your family.</p>

                            <li>trigger finger (a finger gets stuck in a bent position, and straightens with a snap--like a trigger being pulled and released).</li>

                        <p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is rampant in the poultry industry. Poultry workers suffer it at seven times the rate of other workers. It is not a case of short-term discomfort; as it presents in poultry workers, carpal tunnel syndrome can be a permanent and disabling condition. It often requires surgery and—if not properly treated—can prevent those affected from working. Without the normal use of their hands, these workers are unable to continue earning money to support themselves and their families.</p><p>Many workers say that when they ask to be transferred to a different position on the line, in order to let their muscles rest, supervisors often deny their requests.</p>

                                        <p>In one study, poultry workers had 32 times greater odds of being colonized with antibiotic-resistant E. coli than other members of the community. Health experts have reported instances of these workers developing staph infections that are potentially fatal, as they are resistant to treatment.</p>

                        <p>Many companies provide scant training for workers on health, safety, or proper technique. What instruction workers receive is sometimes offered in a language that cannot be understood by all trainees. They are then put to work almost immediately. Consequently—in the absence of proper training—new hires must often assume their position on the line and, while rushing to keep up, watch what other more experienced workers are doing. Naturally, these new workers frequently end up holding or using their tools incorrectly, which can lead to injuries.</p>

                        <hr/>
                        <p>Cumulative injuries can build to the point that a worker can no longer use his hands, arms, or shoulders. And cannot work—at the poultry plant, or another job. Then what?</p>
                        <p>Workers' compensation  is designed to provide cash benefits and medical care to employees who suffer work-related injuries or illnesses. All states have a worker’s comp program. Work such as that done by poultry workers is normally covered but in practice, workers often face significant obstacles to accessing benefits. Plants often argue that the workers’ problems are not related to work, but to another activity. In one case, an employer blamed the repetitive strain injury on a car with manual transmission.</p>
                        <p>Unlike obvious injuries such as an amputation, repetitive strain can be difficult to prove. The damage is largely invisible (other than swelling), and only develops over time, rather than as a result of a single traumatic incident.</p>

                        <h3>Vulnerable populations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Immigrants:</strong> Many poultry workers today are from other countries, including Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru, Ecuador, Somalia, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Nepal, China, and Haiti. These workers face many challenges in learning about and understanding their rights.<br><br>While plants often employ people both English and Spanish-speakers, they rarely provide translators for speakers of other languages. The language barrier makes it difficult for workers to communicate with each other and to speak out.<br><br>Many workers have tenuous immigration status, which makes them especially vulnerable. They fear deportation, which could put families in the US and in their country of origin at risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refugees:</strong> In recent years, the poultry industry has been turning to an especially vulnerable population: refugees who come to the US seeking asylum. In a plant in Texas, Pilgrim’s employs refugees from Burma, while other companies employ refugees from Sudan, Iraq, Eritrea, and Somalia. Refugees are apt to be paid even less than other workers because the poultry industry often uses labor contractors to find these refugees; contractors pay wages directly to the workers--usually less than the plant would pay.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prisoners:</strong> In some plants, prisoners serve as another source of labor.</li>

                        <h3>Harassment and discrimination</h3>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>Poultry companies deliberately take advantage of the demographics of the workforce to create a climate of fear in processing plants.</p>
                        <p>Workers generally have more interaction with their line supervisor than any other personnel in the plant. This person has intimate power over workers on the line; supervisors manage line speed, control bathroom breaks, and access to medical personnel. </p>
                        <p>Some workers say their supervisors are fair, but many workers report that the supervisors—under intense pressure to keep up with production—push line workers to excess. There are frequent reports of rough, or even abusive, tactics. Many workers report that their requests for bathroom breaks are denied. Still others report that they are chastised or derided when they bring injuries or illnesses to their supervisor’s attention.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Point system:</strong> In the effort to control the workforce, many poultry plants use a “point system” to track tardiness, absences, mistakes—even injuries. When the company wants to penalize or dismiss a worker, it can refer to the points, with no other explanation. Supervisors rarely explain or document the system; many workers don’t know how many points they have or how close they are to being fired. So workers live in fear of points, of doing the wrong thing and being fired without warning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bathroom breaks:</strong> Many workers are afraid to ask for permission to go to the bathroom. The supervisor, who needs to find a replacement worker to fill the spot, may yell, penalize, or threaten firing. <br><br>The long waits are especially hard for some workers, including those who are older or pregnant. Some workers take the step of reducing their intake of fluids. Pedro, a former poultry worker for Tyson, simply stopped drinking water: “I figured if I don't drink that much, I won't need to use the bathroom a lot.” He became sufficiently dehydrated that his potassium levels dropped, causing severe leg cramps. <br><br>Bacilio Castro, who worked at a Case Farms plant in North Carolina, recounts the story of a woman who was eight months’ pregnant being denied a bathroom break for two hours. When she eventually peed on herself, the supervisor screamed at her, and took her to the office for disciplinary action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fear of losing jobs:</strong> Many poultry workers come to the US to support families back home. Their parents and relatives depend on them, and workers report deep pain when they can’t provide that support. Consequently workers are terrified of losing their jobs on the line.<br><br>Workers get the message: if they want to keep their jobs, they need to endure what happens inside the plant. Many report that the plant personnel tell them to deal with the conditions, or “There’s the door.”</li>

                        <h3>POVERTY WAGES IN A BOOMING INDUSTRY</h3>
                        <!-- <hr/> -->
                        <p>While the poultry industry is profiting, workers are not. They earn low wages, have scant benefits, and have little, if any, job security. None of the workers interviewed by Oxfam reported receiving any paid time off.</p>
                        <p>Most poultry workers earn wages that leave them close to the poverty line. Wages average $10 to $11 per hour; annual full-time income is $20,000 to $25,000.  The average poultry worker supporting a family of four lives below the poverty line and qualifies for food stamps, Head Start, and the National School Lunch Program. And wages do not keep up with inflation; over the past 30 years, the real value of poultry workers’ wages has declined almost 40 percent.  </p>
                        <p>During this same period, profits have climbed steadily. Poultry executives are enjoying huge leaps in their pay</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The CEO and chairman of Sanderson Farms received $5.9 million in compensation in 2014, a nearly 200 percent increase since 2011.</li>
                            <li>The President and CEO of Tyson Foods earned $12.2 million in 2014: 550 times what the average poultry worker makes. Perhaps more stark, in three and a half hours, he earned the annual salary of a line worker.</li>
                            <li>The President and CEO of Pilgrim’s has seen his compensation rise 290 percent to $9.3 million since 2011.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most plants do not offer substantial raises, even to workers who’ve been there for years. Perdue workers in Maryland reported still earning barely $11 per hour, even after years on the job.</p>

                        <h3>Cheating workers bit by bit</h3>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>Many plants chip away at workers’ pay.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wage theft:</strong> Wage theft is common in the poultry industry. For example, workers are rarely paid for the time they spend preparing for and finishing up after work. In one survey, the Department of Labor found that 100 percent of poultry companies were out of compliance with compensation requirements for “donning and doffing” (putting on and taking off pieces of safety gear) and lunch periods.<br><br>In 2010, Pilgrim’s paid over $1 million in back wages to workers at a Dallas plant for overtime and “donning and doffing.” In 2008, Sanderson paid over $2.6 million in back wages to workers they had not paid properly for time they had worked.<br><br>In most plants, workers stay on the line until all the chickens are processed. While many work more than 40 hours a week, reports of overtime pay are rare.<br><br></li>
                            <li><strong>Questionable accounting practices:</strong> Some companies are now paying workers with debit cards. The cards may force workers to pay a fee (which is illegal), and require workers to go online to find out how much is on the card. Other plants decline to provide workers with paystubs. These practices make it difficult for workers to gather the evidence they would need to file a wage violation complaint.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paying for protective equipment:</strong> Workers are sometimes required to buy their own safety equipment; Perdue workers at plants in Maryland and Delaware report having to pay for their own boots, gloves, aprons, and goggles. In one study, 96.9 percent of the workers were required to either purchase or pay for replacements.</li>

                        <h3>Minimal health insurance</h3>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>Many workers say they receive health insurance through their job but that they must pay $20 to $30 per week for it and it covers only themselves—not their family members.</p>
                        <h3>Lack of paid time off</h3>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>None of the workers interviewed by Oxfam or others report getting any paid time off. No sick days, personal days, vacation days. Indeed, many workers talk about working through illness, and the problems this poses in the plant. Many women talk about how difficult it is to work while pregnant--especially the stress of no bathroom breaks. And there is no paid maternity leave; many return to work shortly after giving birth.</p>

                        <p>Big Poultry treats workers as disposable parts that can be thrown away once they slow down or stop functioning. The industry churns through people, exploiting marginalized and vulnerable populations to do the work.</p>
