									<p><strong>And we eat a lot of it—89 pounds per person each year. Chicken is America’s most popular meat. From nuggets to sandwiches to wings, poultry is a $50-billion industry.</strong>
									<p>But how does all that chicken reach our plates? It’s not easy to turn a live bird into a bucket of buffalo wings. In fact, it takes a lot of work: hanging, cutting, trimming.</p>
									<p>And it takes many, many people working in plants under inhumane conditions: constant health and safety risks, low wages, and a lack of opportunity to speak out about these conditions. Consumers have called on the poultry industry to improve the treatment of chickens, but the plight of workers has received far too little attention. The workers themselves face obstacles that prevent them from speaking out freely about these conditions.</p>
									<p>We’ll show you what the poultry industry doesn’t want you to see, and tell you exactly what you can do to help workers in their struggle.</p>

						<p>The poultry industry is booming. Consumer demand is growing and profits are climbing. Executive compensation is soaring. </p>
						<p>Even the lives of chickens have begun to improve as consumers have voiced concern for their treatment. But one key part of this rocketing industry has been left behind: the people who work processing poultry. Every day, hundreds of thousands of workers become disposable parts of a large, fast, relentless machine. </p>
						<p>These women and men stand on the line hour after hour, faced with an endless stream of chicken carcasses. They hang, cut, debone, twist: repeating the same motions tens of thousands of times each shift, with few moments to rest, stretch, or take a bathroom break.</p>
						<p>The plants are cold, humid, and slippery with grease, offal, blood, and water. The air is full of chemicals from cleaning, processing, and cooking. The machines are loud and the tools are sharp. </p>

						<p>These are tough jobs—and the industry doesn’t make it any easier for the workers. In fact, Big Poultry treats workers as replaceable cogs in their machine; turnover in poultry plants can reach as high as 100 percent every year. To find workers willing to do these jobs, the poultry industry exploits vulnerable people who have few other options: minorities, immigrants and refugees—even prisoners. Because of their precarious situations, most workers are afraid to speak out or do anything that might jeopardize their jobs.</p>
						<p>Poultry workers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>suffer injuries at five times the rate of all workers, </li>
							<li>endure a climate of fear that makes it difficult for them to speak out about their work conditions, and</li>
							<li>earn poverty-level wages.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Of roughly 250,000 US poultry workers, most are people of color, immigrants, or refugees, and many are women.
						<p>Most of us who eat chicken do so because we believe it is a healthy and more environmentally friendly source of protein than other meats. And many of us have spoken out to ensure that the conditions under which chickens are raised are improving. You are making lots of great choices—for your health and the environment—but Big Poultry is keeping some crucial information from you. </p>
						<p>You need to know what really goes on behind the walls of those poultry plants—and what you can you do to help.</p>
						<p>People like you have already pushed Big Poultry to change: Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s, and Perdue have all recently pledged to phase out the use of antibiotics from their chicken supply chain. You spoke and they listened.  They’ll listen again.</p>
						<p>Fear has kept many poultry workers silent.  You don’t have to be. Speak up and help them share their stories.</p>

						<h3>Call on Big Poultry for Change</h3>
						<hr/>
						<p>Workers throughout the poultry industry face these problems. But the companies at the top have a responsibility to act. Four chicken companies control roughly 60 percent of the American poultry market: Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, and Sanderson Farms. These companies are so big that if they make changes, other poultry companies will have to follow. They can and should implement changes that will improve conditions for poultry workers, by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>providing a safe environment in plants, and caring for workers properly when they’re injured; and</li>
							<li>allowing workers to have a voice in the workplace, including the freedom to speak out about problems and greater input into the decisions that affect their work; and compensating workers fairly.</li>
						</ul>
